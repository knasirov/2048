# 2048

## Background

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game originally made by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game is very similar to Threes app. The player is presented with a 4x4 grid. At the start all the grids are empty except for two, which are either 2 or 4. The player uses arrow keys to slide the tiles. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. Tiles will slide as far as possible filling all the empty tiles in the given direction. If two tiles of the same value touch, they merge into one with the value equal to sum of these tiles. The score is increased by the value of this new tile. After the sliding and merging, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 will be generated in one of the empty spots.
